Dear Sir or Madam,

    Say x is 10.

    Say error is "This should not appear".

    If 'x is greater than 5' then
        Please show "x is greater than 5".
    Otherwise if 'x is less than 5'
        Please show "x is less than 5".
    Otherwise if 'x is equal to 5'
        Please show "x is 5". 
    Or else
        Please show error.
    and that is it.

Sincerely,
Mr. Proper
